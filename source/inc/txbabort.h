/*
 * some conditions are both "should not occur" and "should not
 * continue" errors. i prefer using assert to detect errors and end
 * execution but it can be disabled via -D NDEBUG. that's a standard
 * definition for release builds. while i don't expect any of these
 * libraries to end up in released software i will follow the
 * standard.
 *
 * i'm replacing my preferred 'assert(must be true condition &&
 * "descriptive message")' with this 'abort_if' macro. this will
 * reverse various conditional checks throughout these libraries.
