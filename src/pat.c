/*
 * a match string expression is compiled into pattern buffer. the
 * buffer is a one dimensional array of unsigned integers. a pattern
 * item occupies at least one entry in the array. the item code is
 * symbolically identified by the macros PAT_???.
 *
 * the first item in the array is always PAT_BEG, and the last is
 * always PAT_END. PAT_END is guaranteed to be followed by an
 * unsigned integer zero.
 *
 * pattern items occupy a variable number of slots.
 *
 * many single character match string specifications take only
 * one slot:
 *
 * ^ for start of line, $ for end of line, and . for any single
 * character matches all take one slot.
 *
 * common character type matches for digits, letters, and whitespace
 * all take one slot (\d, \w, \s) as do their negations.
 *
 * quantifiers (*, ?, +) all take only one slot.
 *
 * character classes or groups, where any one character can be matched
 * or excluded from a list ([], [^]) occupy three slots plus one slot
 * for each character in the group.
 *
 * runs of characters to match exactly also occupy three slots plus
 * one slot for each character in the run.
 *
 * while literals are stored and processed as runs in the pattern
 * buffer, a quantifier following a literal run actually only refers
 * to the _last_ character of the run. [ab]cde* matches acd, bcd,
 * bcdeeeee, and so on, not acdecde.
 *
 * as yet there is no match grouping so (abc)* does not mean zero or
 * more repetitions of abc, and instead will match (abc, abc), abc))
 * and so on.

 * diagnostics are limited and the code takes a "when in doubt, abort

 * \w                    word character
 * \W                    non word character
 * \d                    digit character
 * \D                    non digit character
 * \n \t \f retain their common meanings
 * [      start a class of characters, matches any one character

 * )      end of a group
 * |      or or choice, one or the other but not both.
 * {      start a specific repeat quantifier, + is equivalent to {1,}

 *        {,max} up to max times
 *        {min,max}

/*
 * programming notes:
 *
 * tokenizing and matching may be the poster child for the switch
 * statement, and i started out using it, but i've been removing it
 * where i can. the formatting is flow breaking, and you can't define
 * variables under a case: clause unless you enclose the code in {}.
 *
 * it's just too irregular. and then there's the mistaken urge to use
 * case: drop through to "save space." storage is cheap, and
 * forgetting a break statement is annoying.
 *
 * i use early exits and continues to avoid many run on if/else if/...
 * constructs, but there are places where it makes sense to group code
 * in one. its a hint to the reader that these blocks are very
 * related.
 *
 * matching is done on characters, which in my world means 8-bit
 * bytes, but i don't try to save much space. the compiled pattern is
 * stored as a list of unsigned int values, 'wasting' anywhere from
 * one to seven bytes depending on your platform. off boundary fetches
 * are a thing, but so is in cache reads. the efficiency isn't a big
 * deal either way, and this approach should handle switching to
 * wchar_t based strings instead of char without much difficulty.

 * - one slot for the literal character marker
 * - one slot for the number of characters to follow (1 right now)
 *   one slot for the actual

 * a character class group takes two slots to begin the group, a
 * slot for the number of members of the class, one slot for
 * each character in the class, and one slot to end the class.
 *
 * the initial allocation is three slots per each character in the
 * match string (actual length or sixteen characters, whichever is
 * more) plus three additional slots for begin and end of pattern
 * markers and a terminal nil entry.
