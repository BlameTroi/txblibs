/*
 * programming notes:
 *
 * tokenizing and matching may be the poster child for the switch
 * statement, and i started out using it, but i've been removing it
 * where i can. the formatting is flow breaking, and you can't define
 * variables under a case: clause unless you enclose the code in {}.
 *
 * it's just too irregular. and then there's the mistaken urge to use
 * case: drop through to "save space." storage is cheap, and
 * forgetting a break statement is annoying.
 *
 * i use early exits and continues to avoid many run on if/else if/...
 * constructs, but there are places where it makes sense to group code
 * in one. its a hint to the reader that these blocks are very
 * related.
 *
 * matching is done on characters, which in my world means 8-bit
 * bytes, but i don't try to save much space. the compiled pattern is
 * stored as a list of unsigned int values, 'wasting' anywhere from
 * one to seven bytes depending on your platform. off boundary fetches
 * are a thing, but so is in cache reads. the efficiency isn't a big
 * deal either way, and this approach should handle switching to
 * wchar_t based strings instead of char without much difficulty.

 *         updated as the string is consumed.
 *
 * the encoded pattern is an array of slots (unsigned ints in the
 * current implementation). each character (meta or literal) in the
 * incoming match string will require at least one slot for a marker.
 * anchors such as begin of line and end of line require only one
 * slot, while others may require more.
 *
 * examples:
 *
 * "a" -> literal character, 1, 'a'
 * "^this" -> bol, literal character, 1, 't', literal character, 'h',
 *            literal character, 'i', literal character, 's'
 * "[abc]" -> a one of the following grouping, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c'
 *
 * as characters are consumed from the match string and placed in the
 * compiled pattern, the current positions within each are updated.
 *
 * as an aid to compilation, the position of the last item is stored
 * in the next available position. this is set to zero when the
 * pattern buffer is marked complete.
